GOT A FEELING
IN MY HEAD
FEELS LIKE THUNDER, OVERHEAD
INTOXICATING
I CAN'T STOP THE FLOW
THIS LOVE IS POISON
BUT IT'S LIKE GOLD
GIVE ME DIRECTION
OUT OF THE COLD
SHOW ME AFFECTION
I'LL GIVE YOU MY SOUL
IT'S OFFICIAL
YOU'RE FANTASTIC
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL
SO ICONIC
YOU'RE THE FOCUS
OF ATTENTION
BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT
COS YOUR SO ON IT
AND IF YOU BREAK ME
WILL YOU FIX ME
AND IF I'M MISSING
WILL YOU MISS ME
AND I'LL REGRET IT,
'TIL THE DAY I DIE
I DIDN'T MEAN IT
IT WAS IN MY HEAD
FEELS LIKE THUNDER
IT'S GETTING COLD
THIS LOVE IS POISONED
BUT IT'S LIKE GOLD
IT'S OFFICIAL
YOU'RE FANTASTIC
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL
SO ICONIC
YOU'RE THE FOCUS
OF ATTENTION
BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT
COS YOUR SO ON IT
IT'S OFFICIAL
YOU'RE FANTASTIC
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL
SO ICONIC
YOU'RE THE FOCUS
OF ATTENTION
BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE ON IT
ONE OF THESE DAYS
ONE OF THESE DAYS
RIGHT WHEN YOU WANT ME BABY
I WILL BE GONE
COS YOUR LIKE PLASTIC
YOU'RE ARTIFICIAL
YOU DON'T MEAN NOTHING BABY
SO SUPERFICIAL
