The whole world's going home with blue plastic bags
Six bottles of Stella, Jacob's Creek and twenty fags
And you know there is no shame
Because we're all doing the same
Staying in is the new going out
No one's even coming round
We'll have toyfights in the hall
You're all going home with self-help books
Hidden behind Heat because you're worried about the looks
And you know there is no shame
Because we're all doing the same
We're just trying to find out
If there's any truth at all
The whole world's listening to downbeat shite
We over-did the good times
Now we can't sleep at night
And you know there is no shame
Because we're all feeling the same
Sing along with the sad songs
Sing along sing along
Sing along with the sad songs
